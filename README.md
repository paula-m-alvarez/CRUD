# CRUD

The application is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) of items. Each item has an image and a description.
To create an item you must press the new item button, then complete the fields and save. It is very important that you complete both fields, otherwise you will not be able to create a new item. Once the item has been created, there will be two options, edit and delete.
Edit allows you to change the item data, either the image or the description. After clicking the edit bottom a preview of the current image will appear on the left. Delete, delete the item completely.
Also on the side you can see a sloth, below it is the item counter, this will be modified according to the amount of items on the screen.
